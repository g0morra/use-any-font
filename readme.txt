== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it works with multiple fonts ? =

Ya, it works with multiple fonts.

= Do i need to manually convert fonts ? =

No, you don't need to do it yourself. Just upload your font(supports most of the font format), and the plugin does the rest.

= I moved my server path and the font is not working now. Why ? =

The plugin is still searching font from your old path. You can delete your old uploaded font and re-upload and re-assign it.
